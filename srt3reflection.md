## Overall Reflection

From the beginning of the school year, I've gained a precursory interested in Physics from deeper reading and preparation for senior year standardized tests, but never had a firm grasp into actually tackling these problems. It was through taking Physics courses as part of the STEM curriculum in De La Salle Santiago Zobel that I supplemented my personal learnings, gained concrete knowledge on how to practically, quickly, and understand how to solve different physics problems. Although I did gain deeper knowledge on core concepts through Physics 1 and 2 from motion to work to angular motion, the most valuable learning was the presentation of various problems, and the thought processes, concepts, and linkages to past lessons that binded a deeper understanding of the lessons.

Ultimately, the most complex of physics problems can be broken down into small steps. They're best viewed as a series of abstractions: in the same way that moving upwards in Physics, whether in high school or in higher education, requires several prerequisites and recommendations before going onwards to more cursory knowledge. This is something that was highly exemplified in the way in-class lessons were taught to usâ€”as well as how general physics problems thrown at one in any field fall into a certain type of problem, to which you can break everything down. Physics anxiety can be rendered near-obsolete when one acknowledges that in principle, it's a matter of building up your knowledge of concepts, and understanding the step-by-step procedure that amalgamates into every given problem. This is applied in all sorts of problems: breakdown, and the ability to link concepts together to solve more complex problems.

It's through these realizations and learnings, as well as practice through a variety of problems and training through approaches that I am able to prepare myself for higher-level problem sets and concepts--something that can't be done without the things I've learned in my physics class.
