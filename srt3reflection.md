**Test Overview**
The third assessment went over the relationship between angular and linear variables in motion, and what is essentially the angular counterpart to linear motion. This involves concepts on velocity, displacement, acceleration, and torque (tendency to cause rotation). 

I was most confident with the assessment and believed that I performed well on it because of my grasp on rotational motion, its relations with previous lessons and concepts, its applications in the real-world (such as how I was able to explain clearly explain the manifestations of torque in objects), and general extensive understanding on it as well as prior practice I had done on the bulk of problems that would be covered. Overall, my familiarity with the concepts from the topic itself such as supporting concepts assisted a lot.

For instance, diving board problems and the understanding of which "blocks" or pillars and the gravitational impact that must be considered in computing for torque. Without knowledge on this (which can be linked back to previously discussed topics on work)--I wouldn't have been able to properly solve an item in the test that was of essentially the same format. Although one can memorize the general procedure for solving rotational motion problems, when encountering problems with different settings, more comprehensive knowledge and understanding that can only be built with strong physics foundations is required.

Another reason why I was most satisfied with this assessment that may not be obvious on paper is that a lot of knowledge resulted from deriving knowledge from past lessons (linear motion) rather than blind memorization of formulas or even full-on familiarity with the problems itself. This is evident by how the way I answered problems wasn't the exact same method that was taught in class. One of the most essential parts to my success in this assessment was familiarity with the diagrams--as I had encountered from the first assessment of the term; knowing which bodies were responsible for which aspects of motion and which parts to consider was critical to my performance. It is also fitting that I had performed best in the latest assessment of the term: physics is about the build-up of concepts.

## Worst

**Test Overview**
Our first physics assessment covered **Work, Power, and Energy**. This was all about motion (rather, causing it), several laws that govern the workings of physics that we're familiar with, and the framework for multiple fields that involve the aforementioned. Distinctions between mechanical and kinetic potential energy, work (and power), were covered in this assessment.

This was my poorest performance because of lack of mastery over the lesson, lack of practice, as well as not being able to grasp the scenarios in certain work problems. Illustrating free-body diagrams is a vital part in better plotting out problems and understanding how different bodies take play on the axes of different issues; of which an inclined plane problem in the test was present that I mistakenly considered the frictional force in. Because I hadn't accurately drawn the vector representations and components of the bodies involved and had a misunderstanding of how the concepts behind the problem worked, I made a simple mistake. My success on the other items was largely due to familiarity with identical items, not necessarily the concepts behind such--which was something I was too dependent on in the test that showed.


## Overall Reflection

From the beginning of the school year, I've gained a precursory interested in Physics from deeper reading and preparation for senior year standardized tests, but never had a firm grasp into actually tackling these problems. It was through taking Physics courses as part of the STEM curriculum in De La Salle Santiago Zobel that I supplemented my personal learnings, gained concrete knowledge on how to practically, quickly, and understand how to solve different physics problems. Although I did gain deeper knowledge on core concepts through Physics 1 and 2 from motion to work to angular motion, the most valuable learning was the presentation of various problems, and the thought processes, concepts, and linkages to past lessons that binded a deeper understanding of the lessons.

Ultimately, the most complex of physics problems can be broken down into small steps. They're best viewed as a series of abstractions: in the same way that moving upwards in Physics, whether in high school or in higher education, requires several prerequisites and recommendations before going onwards to more cursory knowledge. This is something that was highly exemplified in the way in-class lessons were taught to usâ€”as well as how general physics problems thrown at one in any field fall into a certain type of problem, to which you can break everything down. Physics anxiety can be rendered near-obsolete when one acknowledges that in principle, it's a matter of building up your knowledge of concepts, and understanding the step-by-step procedure that amalgamates into every given problem. This is applied in all sorts of problems: breakdown, and the ability to link concepts together to solve more complex problems.

It's through these realizations and learnings, as well as practice through a variety of problems and training through approaches that I am able to prepare myself for higher-level problem sets and concepts--something that can't be done without the things I've learned in my physics class.
